    <div class="FAQ"><h5>Q: Is the Vanish Plate legal?
    A: The legality of the Vanish plate varies by jurisdiction. It is your responsibility to research and comply with the laws in your area before using the Vanish plate. In general, it is illegal to intentionally obscure your license plate from view while driving, but there may be exceptions for certain situations such as car shows or off-road use.</h5><h5>Q: Can the Vanish Plate be installed on any car?
    A: The Vanish Plate can be installed on most cars that have a standard license plate size and mounting location. However, some cars may require custom installation or modifications to work with the Vanish Plate. It is recommended that you consult with a professional installer or mechanic to ensure proper installation.</h5><h5>Q: How does the Vanish Plate work?
    A: The Vanish Plate uses a technology called PDLC (Polymer Dispersed Liquid Crystal) to obscure the license plate. When the device is activated by pressing the wireless button, an electric current is sent to the PDLC film, causing it to change from clear to opaque. This effectively hides the license plate from view.</h5><h5>Q: Will the Vanish Plate drain my battery?
    A: The Vanish Plate draws approximately 1 watt of power when in use. While this amount of power consumption is relatively low, it is important to consider the capacity of your battery. An average car battery should be able to power the device for a significant amount of time before requiring a recharge. However, we recommend monitoring your battery levels to ensure that the device does not drain your battery to a point where it cannot start your vehicle. Additionally, we suggest turning off the device when not in use to conserve power.</h5><h5>Q: Is the device waterproof?
    A: Yes, our product is designed to be fully waterproof. However, while it can handle exposure to water in everyday scenarios, we do not recommend subjecting it to extreme water pressure, such as from a pressure washer or daily car washes. These conditions might exceed the product's waterproofing capabilities and could potentially lead to damage. Always take precautions and use the product as intended to ensure its longevity and optimal performance.</h5><h5>Q: How long is production?
    A: Production time for our products typically ranges from 2 to 4 weeks. As a small company, we take great pride in assembling all components by hand, ensuring a focus on attention to detail and craftsmanship. Our meticulous waterproofing process is designed to guarantee the longevity and reliability of our items, providing you with superior quality products that can withstand various environmental conditions. We appreciate your understanding and patience, and we assure you that the wait is well worth the exceptional quality you will receive</h5><h5>Q: What is your warranty policy?
    A: Our warranty policy offers a 30-day coverage exclusively for manufacturer defects. Within this period, if you encounter any issues related to manufacturing faults, we'll be glad to assist you with a replacement or repair. Please make sure to reach out to our support team to initiate the warranty claim process.</h5></div>
